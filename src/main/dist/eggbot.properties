#######################

# The roll call will generate names for each co-op based on three elements:
# 1 (coop_increment_char): A number or letter that increments for each co-op generated for a contract
# 2 (coop_name)          : The base name which is the same for each co-op and contract
# 3                      : The amount of max players in the contract, taken from the contract's info
